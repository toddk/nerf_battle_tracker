## Building and Running the Project

To build and run this project, you'll need to have the Flutter SDK installed and configured on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd nerf_battle_tracker
    ```

2.  **Install the project dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    You can run the app on a connected device (Android or iOS), on the web, or as a desktop application (macOS, Windows, Linux).

    First, see a list of available devices:
    ```sh
    flutter devices
    ```

    Then, run the app on your chosen device by specifying its ID with the `-d` flag. For example:
    ```sh
    # Run on Chrome
    flutter run -d chrome

    # Run on a connected mobile device
    flutter run -d <your_device_id>
    ```
    If you have only one device connected, you can simply run:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
